# Correlation Analysis: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Organized Crime in 2021 using Python and Jupyter Notebook

This repository encompasses a learning project undertaken as part of my university studies. The project involves a comprehensive correlation analysis between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Organized Crime for the year 2021, implemented using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### This project compelled me to delve into solving various challenges, including:

* Locating datasets of high quality.
* Merging dataframes with partially matching columns.
* Utilizing appropriate color and value scales without manipulation.
* Implementing logarithmic values for enhanced visualization.
* Understanding when to use Spearman and when to use Pearson correlation.
* Interpreting correlation results effectively.
* Knowing when to choose specific types of charts for visualization.

Pyhton Libraries: Numpy, Pandas and Plotly 

This is a correlation analysis without any causalities.
