Correlation analysis between Gross Domestic Produkct (GDP) and Organized Crime of 2021 with Python using Jupyter Notebook.

This repository contains an learning project which is used for my university studies.

If forced me to immerse myself to solve the following problems:
* finding data with good quality
* merging dataframes together with only partially matching columns
* using the right color and value scale without manipulating
* using logarithmic value for better visualization
* when do I use spearmen and when pearson correlation
* how do I inteprete correlation
* when do I use wich chart
